 <u><h3><font color="red">Spondylosis</font></h3></u>
<p>
Degenerative Disc Disease (DDD) or Spondylosis refers to the gradual deterioration of the disc between the vertebrae in the backbone. 
This disease is very common, and affects as much as 40-50% of people over the age of 40. The disorder also becomes increasingly common as we age. 
It is a disease of wear and tear similar to osteoarthritis. It commonly happens in the lumbar spine (low back), though it can occur at any spinal level.

In DDD, the discs get flattened, losing their normal height. This disc height is what separates the disc above from the one below. Nerve pathways
 may become narrowed and cause nerve impingement, inflammation, and pain, when the disc height is lost.

Degenerated discs become much thinner and sometimes the vertebrae also develop small, rough areas which irritate the nearby nerves.
 Severe neck pain and stiffness and pain down the arms and hands can result from this .

Medication and exercises are the first line of management.

Cervical spondylosis is a very common condition where there is chronic degeneration of the bones of the neck (cervical spine) and the cushions between
 the vertebrae (inter vertebral disc). This is managed by cervical spine surgery where the worn out discs or bone spurs are removed - depending on the underlying 
 problem. Sometimes the gap would be filled by a graft of bone or other implants made of metal combined with bone.

Symptoms of spondylosis may be as mild as occasional backaches or could be chronic low back pain that is severe enough to limit daily activities. The mechanical
 type of pain increases as more stress or load is placed on the lower back. Bending, lifting, and twisting are the types of movement that may exacerbate it.</p>

<u> <h3><font color="red">Slipped Disc</font></h3></u>
<p>

Slipped disc is a common term used to refer to a prolapsed disc. This is a disorder when the inner, softer part of the disc bulges out through a weakness in the 
outer part of the disc. The bulging disc may then press on nearby nerves and cause discomfort and pain. Back pain, ache in the arm or leg and pinpricks felt in feet,
toes and hands are the usual symptoms.</p>
<h4>What Are Causes and Risk Factors of a Slipped Disc?</h4>
<p>Risk factors that lead to a slipped disc include aging with associated degeneration and loss of elasticity of the discs and supporting structures;
 injury from improper lifting, especially if accompanied by twisting or turning; and excessive strain forces associated with physical activities. Sudden forceful acute 
 trauma is an uncommon cause of a slipped disc.</p>
 <h4>Symptoms of Slipped Disc:</h4>
 <p>The nerves of the body exit the spine at each spinal level in the low back, mid back, and neck. A herniated disc can produce symptoms anywhere along the course of that 
 nerve, though the injury and irritation of the nerve are at the spine itself. (This is known as referred pain, as the pain is "referred" from the source of the problem in
 the spine to the area supplied by the affected nerve.) A slipped disc can produce varying degrees of pain in the back or neck along with numbness or weakness in the
 corresponding organs, arms, or legs as follows:</p>
<p>For slipped discs in the neck: Neck symptoms and other associated symptoms include numbness, tingling, weakness, or pain in the shoulder, neck, arm, or hand.
 Symptoms of a herniated disc in the neck often increase or decrease with neck motion.</P>
<p>For slipped discs in the lower back, back symptoms include<br/>
1. Pain down the back of each leg from the buttocks to the knee or beyond (this is called sciatica, as it affects the sciatic nerve)</br>
2. Numbness, tingling, weakness, or pain in the buttocks, back, legs, or feet or all of these as in sciatica</br>
3. Numbness and tingling around the anus or genitals</br>
4. Pain with movement, straining, coughing, or doing leg raises</br>
5 Difficulty controlling bowel movements or bladder function</br></p>

<u> <h3><font color="red">Spondylolisthesis</font></h3></u>
<p>
The Greek term for slipping of the spine is Spondylolisthesis . The Greek term for slipping of the spine is Spondylolisthesis.
 This term refers to the abnormal forward movement of one vertebra over the one below. It is in the lumbar spine that this forward slip of the vertebra
 happens most often. Pressure on the nerve roots associated with the affected vertebrae, as well as pain and dysfunction are caused by the slippage and herniation
 of the disc. The types of spondylolisthesis include:</p>

<h4>Type 1 - Congenital spondylolisthesis</h4>
<p>Congenital spondylolisthesis is a condition where a person is born with the abnormality of the posterior bony arch of the spine, which causes the slippage. 
It happens at the L5-S1 level commonly and is associated with abnormality of the facet joints. Symptoms include back pain during the adolescent growth spurt. CT
 and MRI scans are required to diagnose the dysplasia (abnormal bone formation).</p>

<h4>Type 2 - Isthmic spondylolisthesis<h4>
<p>Isthmic spondylolisthesis is a defect in a part of the bone called the pars interarticularis. This bone connects the upper joint of one vertebra to the lower joint.
 Stress fracture in individuals with a hereditary predisposition (some minor abnormality or weakness of the pars at birth) usually causes this. Sometimes a defect may exist 
 without any forward slip, and this is called spondylolysis. This can also be painful.</p>

<h4>Type 3 - Degenerative spondylolisthesis</h4>
<p>Forward slippage secondary to arthritis of the spine is known as Degenerative spondylolisthesis. This process is usually also associated with Spinal stenosis.
 Long standing degenerative disc disease, leading to weak facet joints in the back of the spine is the reason. This is usually seen at L4-L5 level. This is also
 called Lumbar Spondylolisthesis.
