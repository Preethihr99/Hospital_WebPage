<h3 style="font-family: Arial"><u><font size="6px" color="#1589FF"> 320 slice CT Scanner</font></u></h3>
<p style="font-family: Arial"><font size="4px"> The 320 Slice CT Scanner is the 7th of its kind in the world, and a first for India. It is available only at a few leading 
hospitals across the world. The 320 Slice CT Scanner can image the entire heart in a single rotation providing volumetric temporal resolution that is superior to multi-slice 
temporal resolution available today, resulting in clearer image quality. It shows not only whole organ anatomy, but also the changes in the entire organ over time resulting 
in a better, faster, more complete diagnosis. In addition, it can perform a comprehensive neurological examination providing arterial, venous and whole brain perfusion in a 
single study with both less contrast and radiation dose. It is especially helpful in identifying the level of heart disease in people with high cholesterol levels and high 
blood pressure but with few overt signs and symptoms. This facility is currently available at Torrance Hospitals Chennai.</font></p>

<h3 style="font-family: Arial"><u><font size="6px" color="#1589FF">64 Slice CT Angiography </font></u></h3>
<p style="font-family: Arial"><font size="4px">64 Slice CT Angiography is a non-invasive procedure that helps in detecting minute blockages of the arteries of the heart.
 The images obtained through this procedure are sharp and crystal clear, enabling cardiologists to spot even the smallest of blockages at a very early stage. 
 It is also used to determine the conditions of the stents and bypass surgery grafts of patients who have had angioplasties or CABG. Torrance Hospitals, India was the 
 first in the country to introduce this sophisticated cardiac investigation. This facility is currently available at Torrance Hospitals Chennai and Kolkata.

<h3 style="font-family: Arial"><u><font size="6px" color="#1589FF">Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE)</font></u></h3>
<p style="font-family: Arial"><font size="4px"> Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE) is used to determine whether a patient who has an abnormal heart rhythm is at high 
risk for stroke. 
The procedure also reveals any blood clots present in the heart.</font></p>

<h3 style="font-family: Arial"><u><font size="6px" color="#1589FF">Stress Echocardiography in India</font></u></h3>
<p style="font-family: Arial"><font size="4px">Stress Echocardiography uses exercise or medication to make the heart work harder than when at rest. 
This helps us obtain more detailed pictures of the heart and how well or poorly it is functioning. Echocardiography assesses the overall function of the heart, 
determines the presence of heart diseases, follows the progress of valve disease and evaluates the effectiveness of medical or surgical treatment. </font></p>

<h3 style="font-family: Arial"><u><font size="6px" color="#1589FF"> Electrophysiology [EP] Study</font></u></h3>
<p style="font-family: Arial"><font size="4px">  Cardiac Electrophysiology is a specialized procedure in which one or more thin, flexible wires, 
called catheters are inserted into a blood vessel (usually the groin) and guided into the heart. Each catheter has two or more electrodes to measure 
the heart's electrical signals as they travel from one chamber to another. An Electrophysiologist is a trained cardiac specialist who would be performing an EP Study.

Torrance Heart Institutes, India conducts Electrophysiological study to diagnose cardiac rhythm abnormalities. With a team led by the most adept Electrophysiology
 specialists in India, we determine the best treatment and pinpoint the exact site where therapy may be useful. The centre, with its world class infrastructure,
 technology and experience, is considered to be the best hospital for Electrophysiology in India.</font></p>
