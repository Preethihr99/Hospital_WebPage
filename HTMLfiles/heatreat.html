Cardiothoracic surgery involves the treatment of diseases affecting organs inside the chest (thorax), including cardiology treatment which involves 
conditions of the heart and lungs. The Center of Cardiothoracic Surgery at Torrance Hospitals is considered to be the best hospital in India for heart surgery.
This centre of excellence provides a wide spectrum of options for heart treatment in India with superior clinical outcomes. With state of the art 
infrastructure, technology and clinical expertise, thousands of International patients visit Torrance Hospitals for undergoing heart surgery in India.</em></font>

 <h3><font color="blue">Cardio Surgical</font></h3>
<p>The cardio surgical unit has performed a wide range of surgeries ranging from neonatal open-heart surgeries to aneurysm surgeries to heart transplants,
 with excellent results. The Center has performed over 1,52,000 surgeries making it one of the most experienced heart surgery hospital, 
 not only in India but also in South East Asia.</p>

 <h3><font color="blue">Minimally Invasive Coronary Bypass Surgery (CABG) in India</font></h3>
<p>CABG or Coronary Bypass surgery in India is conventionally performed by splitting or cutting through the breastbone or sternum.
 MICAS or MICS CABG surgery is considered to be a safe and complete operation and has revolutionised the way coronary surgery is performed. 
 Torrance Hospitals has successfully completed 400 and more CABG surgeries in India.
MICS CABG or MICAS stands for Minimally Invasive Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery and is a newer form of heart bypass surgery in India. 
It is a relatively new and advanced technique of performing coronary bypass for the treatment of coronary heart diseases. In this technique,
 the heart is approached through the side of the left chest via a small 4 cm incision. This cut is placed just under the nipple. The chest is entered between the
 ribs without cutting any bones and by splitting the muscle.

Similar to a regular heart surgery, the operation is performed using all arteries or a combination of arteries and veins removed from the leg. 
The vessel from the leg in these operations is also removed endoscopically without cutting the skin over the leg. With highly advanced instrumentation, 
advanced techniques and skilled Clinicians, Torrance Hospitals performs the surgery very safely, making it one of the best hospitals for CABG surgeries in India.</p>
<br/>
<h3><font color="blue">Beating Heart Surgery in India</font></h3>
<h4>Off-pump or Beating Heart Surgery</h4>
<p>Coronary Bypass Surgeries are performed using contemporary techniques including the off-pump artery bypass surgery. 
Over 99.6% of the surgeries are off-pump or beating heart surgeries. During off-pump or beating heart surgery, the heart-lung machine is not used. 
The surgeon uses advanced operating equipment to stabilize (hold) portions of the heart and bypass the blocked artery in a highly controlled operative environment. 
Meanwhile, the rest of the heart keeps pumping and circulating blood to the body. Traditional surgery vs. beating heart coronary artery bypass surgery offers patients
 faster post-operative recovery and extracts less of a toll on their systems. Torrance Hospitals are pioneers in the field of Cardiology and Cardiothoracic surgery and 
 is considered to be one of the best beating heart bypass surgery hospitals in India.</p>
 <br/>
 <h3><font color="blue">Emergency Cardiac Surgery</font><h3><p style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font size="3px">
Surgeries for treatment of complications caused by the dilatation of the aorta (aortic aneurysm), problems caused by irregular heart beat 
(arrhythmias - such as atrial fibrillation), heart failure, Marfan syndrome - a genetic disorder that causes cardiovascular abnormalities and 
other less common conditions are performed extensively.</font></p>
<br/>
<h3><font color="blue">Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR)</font></h3>
<p>Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) is used to determine if a cardiac patient really needs a stent or bypass surgery or can be kept only on medicines avoiding any procedure.
 This highly scientific and evidence based procedure is beneficial to the patient as FFR technology not only saves lives while avoiding unnecessary surgery but also helps 
 patients to save cost. Fractional flow reserve - guided stent implantation has been established to be economically attractive in cost-effectiveness analysis.

Patients with heart disease have blockages in the blood vessels (arteries) of their heart. When these blockages limit the amount of blood able to flow through the artery,
 they are "hemodynamically significant" or "serious blocks." These "serious or tight" blockages often cause frightening symptoms such as chest discomfort or shortness 
 of breath and can cause a heart attack. Blockages in blood vessels are identified during diagnostic Coronary Angiogram which forms the basis of most decisions whether
 the particular patient needs a stent or bypass or only medicines. This approach is perfectly reasonable when the Angiogram clearly demonstrates either a severely 
 blocked blood vessel or a normal one. However, Angiography has well-known limitations and the significance of lesions of moderate severity is often difficult to 
 determine based on just the Angiogram.</p>
