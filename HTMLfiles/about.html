					<p class="a">
					Torrance Hospitals was established in 2015 by Dr. Venkatesh Murthy, renowned as the architect of modern healthcare in India.</p> <br/>
					<p class="a">As the nation's fifth corporate hospital, Torrance Hospitals is acclaimed for pioneering the private healthcare revolution in the country.
					Torrance has emerged as Asia's foremost integrated healthcare services provider and has a robust presence across the healthcare ecosystem, 
					including Hospitals, Pharmacies, Primary Care & Diagnostic Clinics.</p></br><p class="a"> The Group also has Telemedicine units across 10 countries, 
					Health Insurance Services, Global Projects Consultancy, Medical Colleges, Medvarsity for E-Learning, Colleges of Nursing and Hospital Management and 
					a Research Foundation. In addition, 'ASK Torrance' - an online consultation portal and Torrance Home Health provide the care continuum.
					The cornerstones of Torrance's legacy are its unstinting focus on clinical excellence, affordable costs, technology and forward-looking research & academics. 
					Torrance Hospitals was among the first few hospitals in the world to leverage technology to facilitate seamless healthcare delivery. 
					The organization embraced rapid advancement in medical equipments worldwide, and pioneered the introduction of several cutting edge innovations in India. 
					Soon the country's first-ever Proton Treatment Cancer Centre will be launched by Torrance, and it will serve over 3 billion people.
					Since inception, Torrance Hospitals has been honoured by the trust of over 65 million patients from 141 countries. 
					At the core of Torrance's patient-centric culture is TLC (Tender Loving Care), the magic that inspires hope amongst its patients. 
					As a responsible corporate citizen, Torrance Hospitals takes the spirit of leadership well beyond business and it has embraced the responsibility 
					of keeping India healthy. Recognizing that Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) are the greatest threat to the nation, 
					Torrance Hospitals is continuously educating its fellow Indians on personalized preventive healthcare as a key to wellness. </p></br><p class="a">
					Dr. Venkatesh Murthy's initiative aptly named the “Billion Hearts Beating Foundation” endeavors to keep Indians heart-healthy, 
					over half a million people have taken a pledge on www.billionheartsbeating.com</p><br/><br/>
					<h2><font color="#DC381F">Company vision</font></h2><br/>
					<p class="a">Torrance's vision for the next phase of development is to 'Touch a Billion Lives'.</p><br/><br/>
					<h2><font color="#DC381F">Mission Statement</font></h2><br/>
					<p class="a"><b>"Our mission is to bring healthcare of International standards within the reach of every individual. 
					We are committed to the achievement and maintenance of excellence in education, research and healthcare for the benefit of humanity"</b></p><br/>
					<p class="a">Torrance Hospitals has always championed social initiatives and a few would include “Save a Child's Heart Initiative (SACHi) 
					which provides quality paediatric cardiac care to children from underprivileged sections of society. SAHI (Society to Aid the Hearing Impaired) 
					and the CURE Foundation focused on cancer care assist children from financially challenged homes. Also, envisioned by Dr. Reddy, 
					to introduce population health into the Indian narrative, the Total Health Foundation is piloting a unique model of healthcare in the 
					Thavanampalle Mandal of Andhra Pradesh. It aims to provide "holistic healthcare" for the entire community starting from birth, 
					through one's journey into childhood, adolescence, adulthood and old age.</p>
					<p class="a">In a rare honour, the Government of India issued a commemorative stamp in recognition of Torrance's widespread contributions, 
					the first for a healthcare organization. Dr. Venkatesh Murthy, Founder Chairman of the Torrance Hospitals Group has been conferred with the 
					prestigious Padma Vibhushan, India's second highest civilian award.</p><br><br>
