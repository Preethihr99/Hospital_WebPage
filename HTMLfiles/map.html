	<p><font size="4px" color="#461B7E"> It has always been our passion and desire to make our expertise, experience and technology available to every individual in our country. 
	Torrance Hospitals' commitment to make good healthcare available to everyone led to the birth of Torrance Reach - a first of its kind endeavour to make 
	advanced technology and experienced medical professionals accessible to the people living in rural and semiurban areas in the country.

Shri. Dr. Narendra Modi, Hon’ble Prime Minister of India inaugurated the first Torrance Reach Hospital at Delhi in 2015 . 
This marked the official launch of Torrance Reach Hospitals, a pioneering initiative of the Torrance Hospitals Group envisaged for reaching world-class healthcare 
to semi urban and rural India. Setting up hospitals in rural or semi-urban areas is a rigorous, time-consuming procedure. Our 3 years of experience in setting up
 hospitals across the country and the world, has helped us accurately identify Indian towns that are in urgent need of healthcare facilities.

We have a wide array of offerings apart from regular medical facilities including pharmacies to insurance services, which will now be available to those in semi-urban
 regions as a result of this initiative. Torrance Hospitals has some of the best medical professionals across various specialties and they too can now be accessed by
 individuals in semi-urban regions through the new platform called telemedicine. In case of a serious medical condition that requires a specialist’s diagnosis or second 
 opinion, patients simply have to walk in to Torrance Reach and access the respective specialist by telemedicine. We are in the process of establishing more facilities 
 across the country, are already underway. We look forward to expanding our reach in the years to come, till our dream of bringing quality healthcare within the reach 
 of every individual becomes a reality.</font></p>
